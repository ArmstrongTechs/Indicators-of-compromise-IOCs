2024-01-11,Other,text,"Volexity has uncovered active in-the-wild exploitation of two vulnerabilities allowing unauthenticated remote code execution in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN devices. An official security advisory and knowledge base article have been released by Ivanti that includes mitigation that should be applied immediately. However, a mitigation does not remedy a past or ongoing compromise. Systems should simultaneously be thoroughly analyzed per details in this post to look for signs of a breach.

During the second week of December 2023, Volexity detected suspicious lateral movement on the network of one of its Network Security Monitoring service customers. Upon closer inspection, Volexity found that an attacker was placing webshells on multiple internal and external-facing web servers. These detections kicked off an incident response investigation across multiple systems that Volexity ultimately tracked back to the organization's Internet-facing Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliance (formerly known as Pulse Connect Secure, or simply Pulse Secure). A closer inspection of the ICS VPN appliance showed that its logs had been wiped and logging had been disabled. Further review of historic network traffic from the device also revealed suspect outbound and inbound communication from its management IP address. Volexity found that there was suspect activity originating from the device as early as December 3, 2023.

At this point in its incident response investigation, Volexity suspected a zero-day exploit was likely at play but did not yet have enough evidence to support this theory. Volexity and its customer worked closely with Ivanti in order to obtain disk and memory images from the impacted devices. Forensic analysis of the collected data provided insight into a variety of the attacker's tools, malware, and methods for operating.",
