2024-08-27,Payload delivery,email-body,"The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is pleased to inform you that your business may be eligible for a Hardship Allowance Plan (HAP) for your COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). 

A HAP can significantly reduce your monthly loan payments, potentially offering financial relief during these challenging times. We've attached a document outlining the details of your eligibility and the HAP program benefits. 

This document includes:

* Confirmation of your potential HAP eligibility (based on preliminary review) 

* Specific details on the HAP program and its benefits (lowered payments, extended repayment terms) 

* A link to the official HAP application portal, if applicable 

Important:

* Review the attached document carefully to determine if the HAP program aligns with your business's current financial situation. 

* The application process can take time, so we recommend applying for the HAP as soon as possible if you're interested. 

For any questions regarding the HAP program or its application process, please don't hesitate to contact our dedicated COVID-19 EIDL Customer Service team at: 

* Phone: 833-853-5SBA (TTY: 711) 

* Email: 

[REDACTED][REDACTED]
* Online on the MySBA Loan Portal 

We understand the ongoing impact of the pandemic on small businesses. We're committed to supporting your recovery efforts through programs like the HAP. 

Sincerely,

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
